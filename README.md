## Prerequisites

1. **Gitpod Personal Access Token**:
   - Go to [Gitpod User Settings](https://app.gitpod.io/settings/personal-access-tokens)
   - Create a new token with necessary permissions
   - Add it as a GitHub secret named `GITPOD_TOKEN`

2. **Organization ID**:
   - Get your organization ID from Gitpod Flex dashboard
   - Add it as a GitHub secret named `GITPOD_ORGANIZATION_ID`

## Cleanup Criteria üîç

An environment is deleted only if ALL conditions are met:
- Not started for X days (configurable)
- Currently in STOPPED phase
- No uncommitted changes
- No unpushed commits

## Security Considerations

- Always store your Gitpod token and organization ID as GitHub secrets
- Review the environments being deleted in the action logs
- Consider starting with a higher `OLDER_THAN_DAYS` value and gradually decreasing it
